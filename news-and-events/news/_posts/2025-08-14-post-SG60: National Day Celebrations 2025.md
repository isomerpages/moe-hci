<p>This year, as Singapore turned 60, High School and College came together
to kick off the nation’s Diamond Jubilee with the annual National Day Parade
at the Terraces featuring a march past by students from NCC, NPCC, Scouts,
St John and the School Band.</p>

<p>Notably, High School combined their annual National Day Celebrations with
Racial Harmony Day for the first time. The students brought the celebrations
to life with their heartfelt performances in Kah Kee Hall.</p>
<p>The highlight of the concert was "BOOTS" — a moving blend of drama, music,
and voices from the HCI community, telling the story of two brothers navigating
their different paths toward Singapore’s future, guided by courage, care,
and unity.</p>

<p>After the concert, the celebration continued with vibrant Racial Harmony
Day activities, reminding us that our diversity is our strength.&nbsp;
Through participating in energetic Bhangra dances, learning about the Ubin
Orang Pulau lifestyle, and hearing about service learning with migrant
workers, students experienced the rich tapestry of cultures that make up
Singapore, deepening their appreciation for our shared heritage and the
many communities that call this island home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over at College, students participated in carnival game booths
by Student’s National Education Council. The booths featured local goodies
such as muah chee and dragon beard candy. At the same time, dazzling performances
by Faculty Committees and performing arts groups, including MADERN, Concert
Band, and others, filled the air with familiar National Day tunes and dances,
bringing the community together in celebration of our nation’s Diamond
Jubilee.</p>

<p>Together, we celebrated this milestone by remembering our past, cherishing
our present, and looking ahead to build a brighter future for generations
to come.&nbsp;</p>
