<p>Organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, this five-day workshop
challenged pre-university students to reimagine publicly accessible open
spaces near their schools, balancing sustainability with real urban demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under a tight timeline and rigorous critique sessions with architects,
planners and academics, the team conceptualised, designed and built a 3D
model of their proposal, navigating complex trade-offs, spirited debates
and real-world constraints along the way.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Colugo, their proposal envisioned naturalising the Bukit
Timah Canal and shifting the vehicular traffic along Bukit Timah Road underground,
allowing nature to be better integrated into daily lives of local residents
and users of the space while reducing the urban heat island effect.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Their ability to interweave ecological sensitivity with bold urban redesign
reflects the very best of Hwa Chong’s problem-solving spirit.</p>
