The two conditions are:<br>
1 ) one of the content subjects is contrasting and; <br>
2 ) the respective subject requirements / pre-requisites are satisfied.

In addition, students can also put in an Odd Subject Combination choice (i.e. for subject combination not found in the standard list).

Note: In addition to taking the above subjects, ALL students are required to take H1 General Paper (GP) and Project Work (PW). H2 Knowledge &amp; Inquiry (KI) is taken in lieu of GP.

JAE students are only allowed to offer subject combinations in the stream they are posted.
