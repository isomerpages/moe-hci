<center><b>DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION EXERCISE 2023</b></center>

Primary 6 students who are keen to join HCI in 2024 may apply to the school via the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student's aptitudes and&nbsp;strengths, bearing in mind the schools' academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

No Singaporean student will be denied a place in Hwa Chong Institution because of financial reasons.
