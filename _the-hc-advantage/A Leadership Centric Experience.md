##### The Ong Teng Cheong Leadership Development Model:

The Hwa Chongian as a servant leader is one who has people at the core of his being. He is&nbsp; therefore one whose primary purpose for leading is to serve others, by enabling others to&nbsp; accomplish their tasks and realize their potential. He is also someone who is grounded in&nbsp; strong fundamental moral values. Hence the emphasis on 4 orientations of Servant&nbsp;Leadership:

*   Character Orientation&nbsp;
*   People Orientation&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Task Orientation&nbsp;
*   Process Orientation

One succeeds as a leader not by leadership skills but by values, respect, humility and having&nbsp; “a natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to&nbsp; aspire to lead”, as shared by Robert Greenleaf, the founder of modern Servant Leadership&nbsp; movement. The servant-leader is servant first, and the purpose of leading is to serve others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The student leadership development journey in HCI starts with Self-Leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Self-leadership is the foundation for all leaderships. It is an enabling process whereby the&nbsp; students learn to define who they are and what they want, through better self-understanding&nbsp; and personal mastery. It is also constructed within the framework of positive psychology and&nbsp; rooted in our strong foundation of Chinese values. It is about empowering oneself to personal&nbsp; excellence and achieving total wellness and living a pleasant, engaged and meaningful life&nbsp; (Seligman, Martin, 2000).&nbsp;&nbsp;

The foundation of self-leadership and leadership as a whole is Ethical leadership. It entails&nbsp; having a strong moral bearing in terms of values, integrity and moral purpose; and integrating&nbsp; these in their work, relationships, decision-making, etc. which can have positive effects on&nbsp; the morale of individuals, the dynamics and work ethics of the team, and the overall health&nbsp; and climate of the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

People will always be more important than structures and tasks in accomplishing goals. Any&nbsp; system, process or change management are only effective if the people who make them work&nbsp; are effective. Servant leaders motivate and inspire others by understanding them,&nbsp; appreciating their strengths, investing in their development and empowering them to do their&nbsp; best, through Appreciative leadership approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In a more disruptive VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) world, it is an even&nbsp; greater challenge to handle tough, uncomfortable, ambiguous and confrontational situations.&nbsp; The leader needs to demonstrate courage, tenacity, flexibility in thinking, and an open mind set. Servant leaders are equipped with Adaptive leadership competencies to mobilize&nbsp; people and resources, providing the steady leadership to navigate and thrive in a VUCA world.

Putting passion and energy into everything they do, servant leaders seek not only to handle&nbsp; the challenges of the VUCA world but also to thrive and flourish, by enabling, energizing and&nbsp; empowering people to accomplish what they want them to do in the most effective and&nbsp; humane way possible. They provide an uplifting experience for others, leading the charge as&nbsp; Entrepreneurial leaders.
