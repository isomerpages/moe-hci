##### Libraries

We have two libraries in Hwa Chong; the Jing Xian Library in the College section and the Kong Chian Library in the High School section.&nbsp;

The Jing Xian library was founded in 1974, and was renamed in 1983, in honour of the father of the chairman of the management committee then. The Kong Chian Library also has a rich history. It was officially opened as the Kuo Chuan Library in 1957, but was later renamed after one of our founding fathers, Lee Kong Chian in 1967.

In 2019, the Jing Xian library underwent a major revamp and extensive renovation.

It now boasts amongst its splendid facilities a dedicated performance space, a cozy corner with a wide selection of board games, exhibition spaces and multimedia areas for ICT-based lessons. Our Jing Xian library is now a library of the future â€“ a space of creative possibilities combined with integrated classrooms that support greater learning and research styles.
