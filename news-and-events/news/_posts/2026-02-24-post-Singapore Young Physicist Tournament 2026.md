<p>We are pleased to share that our C2 students represented Hwa Chong Institution
at the Category A Finals of the Singapore Young Physicists’ Tournament
(SYPT), held on 14 February 2026 at the School of Physical and Mathematical
Sciences, NTU.</p>
<p>The Singapore Young Physicists’ Tournament (SYPT) tests participants'
ability to solve complicated real-world physics problems. In a typical
Fight, the Reporter has to present their solutions to proposed problems
in a convincing way, defending their stand through scientific discussions
with the Opponent.</p>
<p>Congratulation to the following students for their achievements at the
SYPT:
<br><strong>Bronze Award<br>HCI Team 1: </strong>&nbsp;Zhu Yijun (25S6G),
Luo Zihan (25S66), Lim Kai Yi (26S6H)</p>
<p><strong>Silver Award<br>HCI Team 2: </strong>&nbsp;Jethro Chai (25S6H),

<p>Special appreciation goes out to Mr Peter Bruce Gale and Mr Ang Yong Qin
for their steadfast guidance and mentorship for the students. Their dedication
and commitment as teacher mentors for SYPT were instrumental in nurturing
our students throughout the preparation process. In addition, alumni Xu
Kangyou (24S6G) and Tan Myn Jae (24S6G), also generously returned and coached
their juniors, embodying the strong spirit of mentorship within the Hwa
Chong community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May this achievement mark the beginning of even greater exploration and
discovery, as our students continue their pursuit of knowledge and excellence.</p>
