<p></p>
<p>The Class of 2024 has once again achieved outstanding results in the A-Level
Examinations.</p>
<p>This cohort has demonstrated an enduring commitment to excellence, explored
their passions with purpose, and made a meaningful impact through their
contributions.</p>
<p>Channeling their efforts to uplifting others, the Class of 2024 took on <strong>105</strong> Service-Learning
Projects and impacted close to <strong>200</strong> organisations and their
beneficiaries. In addition, close to 750 students or over 70% of the cohort
have been conferred the Hwa Chong Diploma for holistic excellence.</p>
<p>A testament to the value of a Hwa Chong education, our students continue
to receive numerous offers from both local and renowned overseas universities.
Many also earned places in prestigious scholarship programmes designed
to nurture interdisciplinary thinkers, changemakers, and future leaders
for the nation.</p>
<p>Our appreciation also goes out to the entire Hwa Chong family—including
past and present staff, parents, and alumni—who have been steadfast pillars
of support for our students. We especially acknowledge and thank the staff
of Nanyang Girls’ High School and Hwa Chong Institution for their unwavering
care and commitment.</p>
<p>We are proud of our students who embody the institution motto of 自强不息,
己达达人 where they have been unwavering and purposeful in their pursuit of
excellence, as well as stayed resilient in the face of adversity and be
bold in the face of uncertainty. As such, it is with great pride that we
highlight and celebrate the achievements of several students who truly
embody the Hwa Chong spirit.&nbsp;</p>
