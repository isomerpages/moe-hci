<p>In the first half of the year, after several rounds of national selection,
four Hwa Chong students—Lim Chang Jun (24S6D), Sun Beichen (24S6D), Yaw
Chur Zhe (23S6F), and Zhao Yaoqi (24S6D)—were selected to represent their
countries in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the International
Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).</p>
<p>The IMO and IOI are prestigious annual competitions that challenge participants
with complex problems, testing creativity and problem-solving abilities.
Through rigorous preparation and participation, students not only sharpen
their skills but also build lasting friendships and networks across cultures.</p>

<p>The IMO, held annually since 1959, is one of the oldest International
Science Olympiads. The 65th IMO took place in Bath, United Kingdom, from
July 11 to 22, 2024.</p>
<p>Over his Secondary 4 and JC1 years, Yaoqi participated in numerous math
competitions, including the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO) and the
National Team Selection Test, where he was among the top 6 contestants
to represent Singapore. The team underwent intensive training before the
competition.</p>
<p>The Singapore IMO team earned 5 Silver and 1 Gold medal, placing 6th out
of 108 countries.</p>
<p>"Along the way, I have met many new and interesting people in the Math
community and gained a lot from interacting with them. I wish to thank
my family, teachers, mentors, and friends for their support."
<br>— Zhao Yaoqi (24S6D)</p>
<p>At the 36th International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) in Egypt this
September 2024, three Hwa Chong students earned outstanding results. Yaw
Chur Zhe (23S6F) won a Silver medal, while Sun Beichen and Lim Chang Jun
(both 24S6D) earned Bronze medals.</p>

<p>The IOI, held annually since 1989, is a global competition for high school
students to demonstrate their programming and analytical skills. This year,
Hwa Chong students achieved a historic 1 Silver and 2 Bronze medals.</p>
<p>Beichen and Chur Zhe were among the top 4 participants in Singapore after
excelling in competitions like the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI)
and the Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO).</p>
<p>“I owe much of my achievements to the seniors who first introduced me
to the Informatics Olympiad during HCI’s internal training in 2020. Without
the support of my friends, family, teachers, and the informatics community,
I would not be where I am today. As the head trainer for this year’s internal
training, I hope to inspire others as I was inspired four years ago.”</p>
<p>— Sun Beichen (24S6D)</p>

<p>The students are grateful to Principal Mr. Lee Peck Ping, Deputy Principals
Mr. Chan, Dr. Lim, Mrs. Chin, Ms. Ho, and Ms. Lim, and their teachers for
their guidance and encouragement. Special thanks go to Mr. Ng Say Tiong,
Mr. Zong Lixing, Mr. Lee Yung Hei, Ms. Yu Qian, Mr. Loh Tze Wei, and Mr.
Ma Zhou. They also thank their classmates and friends for their moral support.</p>
