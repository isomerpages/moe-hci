<p>As part of the post-promotional exam activities, students had the opportunity
to Grow, Play and Serve (GPS) ðŸŒ±ðŸŽ®ðŸ’›. The GPS programme encourages them
to grow through play and service, cultivating both personal growth and
a spirit of community.</p>
<p>Students discovered new skills and deepened their passions through fun,
hands-on learning, from workshops such as Public Speaking, Virtual Reality,
and Growing Communication Skills with Science Toys, to meaningful interactions
with the elderly and remote exchanges with children from Vietnam. They
also connected with nature and shared their expertise through student-led
workshops. With support from the PE Department, students participated in
inter-faculty games across various sports such as badminton and football.
Together, these experiences fostered creativity, compassion, teamwork,
and camaraderie, making GPS a memorable blend of learning, play, and service.</p>

<p>Through Grow, Play and Serve (GPS), students had the opportunity to reflect
on their personal development, recharge after the exams, and build stronger
relationships with peers and teachers alike.</p>
<p>As the C1s wrapped up their GPS journey, they took with them not only
new skills and memories, but also a renewed spirit of growth, gratitude,
and service â€” values that define what it means to be a part of Hwa Chong
Institution.</p>
