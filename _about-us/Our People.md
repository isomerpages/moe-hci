##### Our People

<img align="left" style="width:30%" src="/images/people1.jpg">

At Hwa Chong, we offer a wide range of opportunities for students to develop into bicultural and entrepreneurial leaders of character, who are ready to lead and serve Singapore and the global community with passion and compassion.

More than a school, Hwa Chong is where teachers and students work and play as a family. Even after graduation, Hwa Chongians maintain close ties with the school and contribute generously to society.

Hwa Chong is a home, a place where we are supported to be our best, a place where we are challenged but not judged, a place rich in traditions and yet full of innovations, a place where all can flourish.

We want every Hwa Chong student to live with passion and lead with compassion. Everything we do in school is to help us realise this vision.

“学而不思则罔，思而不学则殆”，因此在华中，我们致力于培养能够结合学习和思考并且善于将理论联系实际的学生。

Hwa Chong is a home and more, where we pursue our passions, create possibilities, overcome challenges and celebrate milestones. I am energised to be playing a role to support the school, my fellow colleagues and my juniors. Let us walk and enjoy the journey together.
