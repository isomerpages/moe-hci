<p>The Class of 2025 has once again distinguished itself through strong academic
performance in the A-Level Examinations.</p>
<p>This reflects the culmination of a journey shaped by growth, resilience
and contribution, emphasised through the steady discipline of 自强不息 and
the spirit of gratitude and appreciation embodied in 饮水思源.</p>
<p>Rooted in shared purpose, the Class of 2025 demonstrated meaningful impact
across the college community and beyond. They initiated 136 Service-Learning
Projects, partnering close to 200 organisations and community groups. Over
85% of the cohort earned the Hwa Chong Diploma, affirming holistic development
across scholarship, leadership, service and character. They took home 54
Top 4 titles at the National Schools Games, 8 Certificates of Distinction
and 2 Certificates of Accomplishment at the Singapore Youth Festival Presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their contributions across sports, the arts and society affirm the values
of 己立立人 and 己达达人: establishing oneself in order to uplift others and advancing
oneself in order to advance the collective good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grounded in the strength of our shared journey, our students have received
offers from respected local and international universities. Many have also
been invited into distinguished scholarship programmes that seek to nurture
thoughtful, interdisciplinary minds ready to contribute meaningfully to
the causes they serve.</p>
<p>Even ahead of the release of the A-Level results, several students of
the Class of 2025 were awarded provisional scholarships, including the
Public Service Commission (PSC) Scholarship. Such recognition speaks quietly
of the confidence placed in their character and calibre, qualities nurtured
within a community that pursues excellence with discipline and humility.</p>
<p>Our appreciation also goes out to the entire Hwa Chong family. This includes
past and present staff, parents, and alumni, who have been steadfast pillars
of support for our students. We especially acknowledge and thank the staff
of Nanyang Girls’ High School and Hwa Chong Institution for their continued
partnership in nurturing young men and women who will live with passion
and lead with compassion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our graduates step forward into the next chapter of their lives, they
do so deeply rooted in community, in gratitude, and in the enduring values
of Hwa Chong.</p>
<p>The Class of 2025 rises not alone, but upheld by a community rooted in
purpose.</p>
<p>As such, it is with great pride that we highlight and celebrate the achievements
of several students who truly embody the Hwa Chong spirit.&nbsp;</p>
