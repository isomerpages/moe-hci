At Hwa Chong, we offer a wide range of opportunities for students to develop into bicultural and entrepreneurial leaders of character, who are ready to lead and serve Singapore and the global community with passion and compassion.

More than a school, Hwa Chong is where teachers and students work and play as a family. Even after graduation, Hwa Chongians maintain close ties with the school and contribute generously to society.

Hwa Chong is a home, a place where we are supported to be our best, a place where we are challenged but not judged, a place rich in traditions and yet full of innovations, a place where all can flourish.
