##### Integrated Programme

The strength of Hwa Chongâ€™s IP is in our ability to combine scholastic excellence with an outstanding range of opportunities beyond the classroom. Every Hwa Chong student receives a rigorous curriculum that emphasises leadership, character building, academic excellence, and creativity.&nbsp;

The Hwa Chong Integrated Programme (IP) is designed by our own teachers who have years of experience teaching high ability students. Preliminary consultative work on our IP was done with help from a 34-member International Advisory Panel comprising 2 Nobel Laureates, distinguished professors from Harvard, Princeton and Cambridge as well as eminent industry captains.

Importantly, the school aims to provide a caring environment that is intellectually stimulating, secure, and joyful.

The seamless and broad-based 6-year IP is organised into 3 stages:

*   At Stage 1, students are exposed to a general curriculum that allows them to explore various fields of studies.
*   At Stage 2, students embark on a sustained and in-depth study of their chosen area of specialisation.&nbsp;The curriculum for the Sciences and Humanities will be broad-based at this point.
*   At Stage 3, students consolidate their knowledge and sit for the Cambridge GCE Advanced-Level Examinations.&nbsp;They are expected to be actively involved in outreach programmes and can initiate major research projects which could form the basis of their undergraduate studies.
