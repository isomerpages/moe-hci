#### **(A) Mean Subject Grade**

The grades of H1 and H2 subjects are assigned an equivalent point according to the table below:


|H1/H2 Grade|Equivalent Points|
| -------- | -------- |
|A|1|
|B|2|
|C|3|
|D|4|
|E|5|
|S|6|
|Ungraded|7|

#### **(B) Computation of Points**

Mean Subject Grade is calculated based on the following formula:

[2 (Sum of all H2 grades) + (Sum of all H1 content-based subject grades)]  / [2(No. of H2 subjects) + (No. of H1 content subjects)]

**Examples**

Student A takes 3 H2 and 1 H1 subjects.


||Mathematics (H2)|Physics (H2)|Chemistry (H2)|Economics (H1)| 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Grade|A|B|C|D|
|Points|1|2|3|4|

MSG = [2(1+ 2+ 3) + 4] \ [2(3) + 1] = 2.29  

Student B takes 4 H2 subjects.
||Mathematics (H2)|Physics (H2)|Chemistry (H2)|Economics (H2)| 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Grade|A|B|C|D|
|Points|1|2|3|4|

MSG = (1 + 2+ 3+ 4) / 4 = 2.5.
