<p><strong><u>DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION EXERCISE 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Primary 6 students who are keen to join Hwa Chong Institution in 2026
are welcome to apply through the annual Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise.</p>
<p>We encourage parents and students to make informed decisions when selecting
schools, taking into account the student’s strengths, interests, and aspirations.
It is important to consider each school's distinctive programmes, development
opportunities and culture, as well as the specific academic and non-academic
requirements for admission and talent development.</p>
<p>At Hwa Chong Institution, we are committed to nurturing the holistic development
of every student. In 2026, we are excited to expand our suite of DSA talent
areas with the introduction of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Art Elective Programme (AEP)</strong>: For students with a passion
and potential in the visual arts. Students admitted via this talent area
will be enrolled in our Art Elective Programme, a rigorous and enriching
curriculum designed to stretch students’ artistic and creative abilities,
while deepening their understanding of visual culture and contemporary
art practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong>: For students who demonstrate initiative,
creativity, and an enterprising spirit. This talent area will provide students
with platforms to ideate, prototype, and launch innovative solutions to
real-world problems, supported by mentorship and learning experiences in
business, design thinking, and social impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These new domains complement our existing DSA talent areas such as leadership,
STEM, humanities, sports, and performing arts.</p>
<p>Students admitted through DSA are expected to honour their commitment
to HCI’s six-year Integrated Programme. They are required to actively participate
in the talent development activities related to their selected talent area
from Year 1 to Year 4.</p>
<p>Importantly, no Singaporean student will be denied a place at Hwa Chong
Institution because of financial circumstances. The school offers a comprehensive
range of financial assistance schemes, scholarships, and merit-based awards
to ensure that every student has the opportunity to thrive.</p>

<p>Applicants should only attend the in-person selection if they are well.
If a student is unwell during the selection period, rescheduling will be
arranged where possible.&nbsp;</p>
