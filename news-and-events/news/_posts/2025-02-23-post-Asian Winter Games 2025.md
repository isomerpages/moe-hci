<p>"It's not my first time racing against such powerhouse athletes, but it's
always a very refreshing experience. To race against the best is the best
way to learn from them," said Brandon. “l also had a fun time exchanging
pins and interacting with athletes from other countries. To be able to
wind up behind the powerhouses of this sport, I am very proud of the hard
work and sacrifices I’ve made to achieve this.”</p>
