<p>On 9 Oct 2025, the Hwa Chong community came together to celebrate a significant
milestone — Graduation Day for the Class of 2025. For our C2 students,
it was a moment filled with joy, nostalgia, and gratitude as they marked
the culmination of their two-year journey in the college.</p>

<p>The day began with students gathering in their faculties for one final
time, where they watched class montages capturing laughter-filled memories,
shared inside jokes, and celebrated milestones that defined their Hwa Chong
experience. Each C2 also received a graduation bear, a small but meaningful
token symbolising the friendships, perseverance, and shared spirit that
carried them through their time at HCI.</p>

<p>The Graduation Ceremony was graced by four distinguished Guests-of-Honour:
Ms. Adeline Hong, Director (Transformation) at MSF; Mr. Chua Aik Boon,
President of the HCJC Alumni; Mr. Ho Ren Hua, CEO of Thai Wah Group; and
Mr. Koh Khai Yang, Executive Director, Operations Excellence, Keppel. Their
presence inspired graduands toward purposeful excellence.</p>

<p>Graduation Day was not only about celebrating the students’ achievements,
but also about recognising the teachers who had supported, mentored, and
inspired them. In heartfelt moments across the college, CT representatives
presented appreciation gifts to their civics tutors on behalf of their
classes, which was a gesture that spoke volumes of the deep bonds formed
between students and teachers over the past two years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During Admin Day, Principal Mr Lee Peck Ping addressed the cohort with
a speech themed <em>“Infinite Paths, Infinite Potential.”</em> He reminded
students that success takes many forms and that each individual’s journey
is unique. Drawing from inspiring examples within the graduating batch,
Mr Lee reflected on the cohort’s resilience, camaraderie, and growth throughout
their Hwa Chong years. To further motivate the graduands, he also shared
a video of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who spoke candidly about the value
of resilience and how challenges often lay the foundation for future success.</p>
