<p>The Yellow Ribbon Community Arts Festival (YRCAF) shares the untold stories,
aspirations, and transformative journeys of inmates through art. The theme,
“We are Each Other’s Second Chances”, conveys inmates’ hope for the community
to give them a second chance in life, so they can become contributing citizens
and pay it forward.</p>
<p>This year, young artists from secondary schools and tertiary institutions
were invited to participate in a nationwide art competition, interpreting
this year's theme through fine art and short video clips for the Yellow
Ribbon Arts Competition.</p>
