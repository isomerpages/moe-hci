<center><b>Direct School Admissions Selection Process</b></center>

Applicants will be shortlisted based on available information from MOE and from applicants’ submitted information via the application process.

HCI will be conducting in-person selection for all DSA talent areas for 2023 DSA-Sec.&nbsp;Applicants who are successfully shortlisted will be informed between 4 July to 10 July and they will be required to attend an interview and/or selection tests on <u>**22 July 2023.**</u> Due to the large number of applicants and the limited number of DSA places, not all students who meet the criteria will be shortlisted for an interview.&nbsp;

Please note that applicants should attend the in-person selection only if they are well. For students who are unwell (e.g. tested COVID-19 positive) during the selection period, re-scheduling the in-person selection will be done where possible.

Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school for the duration of the 6-year Integrated Programme, and participate in the activities related to the talent area they are selected for from year 1-4.
