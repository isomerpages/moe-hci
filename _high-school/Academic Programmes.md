##### Integrated Programme

The strength of Hwa Chong’s IP is in our ability to combine scholastic excellence with an outstanding range of opportunities beyond the classroom. Every Hwa Chong student receives a rigorous curriculum that emphasises leadership, character building, academic excellence, and creativity.&nbsp;

The Hwa Chong Integrated Programme (IP) is designed by our own teachers who have years of experience teaching high ability students. Preliminary consultative work on our IP was done with help from a 34-member International Advisory Panel comprising 2 Nobel Laureates, distinguished professors from Harvard, Princeton and Cambridge as well as eminent industry captains.

Importantly, the school aims to provide a caring environment that is intellectually stimulating, secure, and joyful.

The seamless and broad-based 6-year IP is organised into 3 stages:

*   At Stage 1, students are exposed to a general curriculum that allows them to explore various fields of studies.
*   At Stage 2, students embark on a sustained and in-depth study of their chosen area of specialisation.&nbsp;The curriculum for the Sciences and Humanities will be broad-based at this point.
*   At Stage 3, students consolidate their knowledge and sit for the Cambridge GCE Advanced-Level Examinations.&nbsp;They are expected to be actively involved in outreach programmes and can initiate major research projects which could form the basis of their undergraduate studies.

Annually, there are&nbsp;**over 200 different student-initiated service learning projects school-wide**. Selected projects receive financial support from the Citibank Youth for Causes Fund and Campus ChangeMakers by NYC. These include promoting an appreciation of Chinese culture at the Singapore History Museum, conducting web design courses for underprivileged children at community centres, organising rainbow camps for the Salvation Army and creating online learning programmes for primary school students.

In addition,&nbsp;**all Hwa Chong students are involved in different Community Involvement Projects**&nbsp;conducted by their respective consortia and faculties throughout the year. They include painting one-room flats, fund-raising through collecting old newspapers, tutoring pupils from needy families as well as interacting with the dementia elderly and the intellectually disabled.

**Holistic Education Model**

The Hwa Chong Holistic Education Model is informed by Harvard Professor Howard Gardner’s&nbsp;_5 Minds for the Future_&nbsp;(2008)_._&nbsp;It outlines the range of specific cognitive abilities that will be cultivated and sought after by the leaders of tomorrow. This&nbsp;provides the guiding principle for the development of Hwa Chong’s curriculum to foster cognitive capacities in three distinct but overlapping domains – Critical, Creative and Caring Thinking.&nbsp; The Hwa Chong Holistic Education Model also seeks to foster Entrepreneurial Thinking, a quality that is especially crucial in an increasingly uncertain future.

1 \.**Critical Thinking**&nbsp;is aligned to Gardner’s&nbsp;**Disciplined and Synthesising Minds**. To develop the Disciplined Mind, students are given the opportunity to delve in and master major schools of thought in the Sciences, Mathematics, Social Sciences &amp; Languages. This is accomplished through a range of research tasks and projects with internal and external expert mentors. The Synthesising Mind refers to the ability to integrate ideas from different disciplines or spheres into a coherent outcome and to communicate the core essence of that integration well. This is especially important in this era of interdisciplinary integration, where innovative solutions to novel problems are needed. Thus, Hwa Chong aims to nurture a new generation of critical thinkers and effective communicators, factors crucial for success in the 21st&nbsp;century.
