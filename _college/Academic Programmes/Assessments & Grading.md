#### **Assessment Structure & Promotional Criteria:**

 
Our school aligns our School-Based Assessment (SBA) structures in accordance with Ministry of Education’s emphasis on reforming assessment practices. This shift aims to reduce the excessive emphasis on examinations, creating a more conducive environment for the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC).  The adjustments allow a more measured pace in teaching and learning, fostering a learning environment that nurtures students’ intrinsic motivation for learning.

The weightings for Weighted Assessment (WA), Promotional Examination (Promo), and Preliminary Examination (Prelim) are calibrated to appropriately reflect the varying scopes and demands expected of students at different stages of their academic journey. 

Additionally, formative unweighted assessments will be strategically conducted to provide timely feedback, enabling students to address any learning gaps promptly.

Guidelines related to the assessment weightings for both levels are listed below:

1. 	Weighting for each WA in JC1 ranges from a minimum of 10% to a maximum of 20%;
2. 	Total weighting of all WA in JC1 is capped at 30%, excluding Promo;
3. 	JC1 Promo Exam carries a weighting of 70%;
4. 	The weighting for JC2 Prelim remains at 100%.

The table below provides an overview of assessment weightings for JC1 and JC2:

|  | **Weighted Assessment** | **Year End Exam** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **JC1 year**     | 30% (one in T2, one in T3)     | 70% (Promo)     |
| **JC2 year**     | NA     | 100% (Prelim)     |


#### **(B) Reporting**

There are 2 main methods of reporting student progress to parents:

1.	Through progress report in mid-year (both JC1/JC2) and at the end of the school year (for JC1/JC2). 
2.	Through parent-teacher meetings.

Students and parents can log into Intelligent School Portal (ISP) to check their WA/Promo/Prelim results.  The JC1 Overall Results and JC2 Prelim Exam Report for JC2 will be given to students on the last day of school.


#### **Promotional Criteria**

The JC1 overall result is computed from the WA (30%) and Promotional Examination (70%). 

Students will be promoted to JC2 if they meet the following minimum criteria based on the Overall JC1 result.

·       Two H2 passes (E-grade); OR

·       One H2 pass (E-grade) and two H2 sub-pass (S-grade)

Note

(i) A H1 content subject pass (A to E grade) is equivalent to a H2 sub-pass (S-grade)

(ii) A pass in General Paper (A to E grade) is also equivalent to a H2 sub-pass (S-grade) 

Students who repeat JC1 have to take 3H2 1H1 subject combinations.


**Guidelines For Absence From School-Based Assessments (including Examinations)**  

Students who miss any Weighted Assessments, JC1 Promotional Examination and JC2 Preliminary Examination must be covered by a **medical certificate (MC)** or be given exemption by Deputy Principal with valid reason(s). **Parent’s letter citing grounds for absence will not be accepted.** 

Students who are absent from any weighted assessments with valid reasons *are required to attempt the paper as an exercise* and submit to teachers for feedback. The marks will not be counted towards the final grade.

Students who are absent without a valid reason or did not comply with examination regulations will be given **zero** mark for that paper followed by disciplinary actions (if applicable).

If a student is excused with a valid reason from JC1 Promotional Examination, the student may be required to sit for diagnostic assessment(s) on date(s) determined by the school to identify learning gaps and ascertain the readiness of the student for JC2.
