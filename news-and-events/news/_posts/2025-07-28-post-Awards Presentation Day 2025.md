<p>In his heartfelt address, Mr Tay looked back on his time in Hwa Chong,
sharing how the experiences he had here continue to profoundly shape his
values and remain close to his heart. He spoke about the importance of
our core school value, 饮水思源, remembering our roots and honouring our benefactors,
encouraging the graduates to give back to the school and community through
avenues such as the Hwa Chong Junior College Alumni or the Hwa Chong Alumni
Association. He also reminded the graduates to uphold the virtues of kindness
and humility, and be modest about their achievements and success.&nbsp;</p>
