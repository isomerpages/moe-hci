##### College: The Faculty System

Under the Faculty system, students are divided across different streams and subject combinations. This heterogeneous arrangement encourages students to interact and appreciate one other's differences as well as similarities.

Each faculty is led by a team comprising a Senior Consultant (SC), Education Consultant (EC)/ and CCA Teacher. Working very closely with the Civics and Subject Tutors, they oversee the scholastic performance and emotional well-being of students in their respective faculties. The work of the faculties is coordinated and supervised by the PCs/Faculty and Director/Well-Being.

The faculty personnel take on multiple roles. In dealing with the affective aspects of a student's education, he/she takes on the role of a counsellor, disciplinarian and mentor. The SC/Faculty or EC/Faculty is usually the first person the Civics or Subject Tutor turns to when handling a delicate case. Very often, whenever they arise, such cases are a complex mix of emotional and disciplinary issues, each feeding on each other. The SC or EC is empowered to make decisions on-site to intervene in a timely manner to the benefit of our students. Such a decentralised Faculty system of managing students is more efficient in responding to the individual needs of the students. Programmes can also be more flexibly customised to meet the needs of the students within the respective faculties.
