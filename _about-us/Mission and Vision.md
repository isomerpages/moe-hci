&gt; Teachers and students are reminded to maximise the opportunities in HCI when exploring their interests. They should seek to develop these interests into life-long passions. The HCI research-based curriculum hones students’ Disciplined Minds to further develop their passions. The pre-requisites of a Creating Mind are curiosity, innovation and a quest for excellence. Teachers and students should learn to explore possibilities and create platforms to forge breakthroughs in a knowledge-based economy. Both Passion and Innovation lead to constant self-renewal and improvement, which is essentially the spirit of 自强不息.
