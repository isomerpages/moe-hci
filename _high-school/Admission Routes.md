<p><strong>DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION EXERCISE 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Primary 6 students who are keen to join HCI in 2025 may apply to the school
via the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student's aptitudes and&nbsp;strengths, bearing in mind the schools'
academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to
develop the area of talent.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school for the duration of the 6-year
Integrated Programme, and participate in the activities related to the
talent they are selected for from year 1-4.</p>
<p>No Singaporean student will be denied a place in Hwa Chong Institution
because of financial reasons. A range of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hci.edu.sg/admissions/high_school/financial-information-highschool#financial-assistance" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">financial assistance schemes</a>,
scholarships and awards are available to support our students.</p>
<p><strong>The selection criteria and process for the talent areas will be updated from early-May. </strong>For
