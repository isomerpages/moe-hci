<p>Organised by HC LawSoc and the&nbsp; Humanities and Current Affairs Society
(HACAS), Singapore Parliament Learning Journey 2024 raised awareness and
understanding amongst HCI students on the integral legal and policy roles
that Singapore’s Legislative branch plays in its broader governance and
legal landscape.</p>

<p>Over 70 participants enjoyed a guided tour of Parliament House. The tour
was led by experienced and engaging guides who provided detailed explanations.
They covered the history and significance of the Parliament building, including
its architecture and notable features. Additionally, they elucidated the
key Parliamentary Processes, making the tour informative and engaging for
all attendees.</p>
<p>After the guided tour, participants had the invaluable and exclusive opportunity
to engage in a fireside chat with the Speaker of Parliament, Mr Seah Kian
Peng, interacting with him and finding out more about his roles and responsibilities,
debunking misconceptions while encouraging greater political participation
and inspiring students to keep up with developments in Singapore’s governance.</p>
