##### Subjects Offered

**Economics**<br>
The Economics Unit in Hwa Chong comprises a team of dynamic professionals dedicated to the teaching of Economics as a life subject. Economics is not just a collection of facts but a unified approach to thinking about the world. The theory of Economics is an apparatus of the mind or a technique of thinking which helps us make rational decisions. With these requirements in mind, the Economics Unit provides a rigorous course to equip students with the skills necessary for economics awareness and competence. This course imparts both intellectual as well as citizenship training through a well-planned syllabus to promote understanding of the very processes and issues that affect their lives as citizens and students. In addition, Economics Exco was set up to expose students to a range of enriching experiences such as participation in nation-wide competitions, publication of newsletters and trips to overseas to EU and Universities for Summer Programmes. The greatest reward of this course is a better understanding of how the world works.

**Geography**

<center>Geography is the study of Earth’s landscapes, peoples, places and environments...<br>bridging the social sciences with the natural sciences... and puts \[the\]  <br>understanding of social and physical processes within the context of places<br>and regions... \[Geography\] helps us all to be more socially and environmentally  <br>sensitive, informed and responsible citizens...  <br><b>Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)</b></center>

The approach to Geography teaching and learning in Hwa Chong has evolved through the years due to the changing demands of the syllabus and the growing interest amongst the students in the subject. As Geography is an applied discipline, praticisng geographers should be able to make direct contributions to society. Being highly dynamic, the subject constantly seeks to heighten our awareness of the world. It introduces the processes operative in physical and human geography and draws links to how these are relevant to the current social, economic, political and environmental situation.&nbsp; Hence, with these attributes in mind, the syllabus seeks to encourage students to:

1 \. be inspired by the splendour of natural environments and human ingenuity;<br>
2 \. care for delicate ecosystems and understand the importance of environmentally sustainable lifestyles;  <br>
3 \. develop as global citizens, seek harmony and respect others in a culturally diverse world;  <br>
4 \. contribute responsibly towards the building of a robust and inclusive society; and  <br>
5 \. have the integrity to uphold ethical principles and be resilient in their pursuit for a better world.

These aims are achieved through the study of the main Themes in the H2 Geography syllabus:  
Theme 1 : Tropical Environments <br>
Theme 2 : Development, economy and the Environment <br>
Theme 3 : Sustainable Development <br>
Theme 4 : Geographical Investigation

At Hwa Chong, we also aim to develop students with a global perspective, imbued with the spirit of inquiry and empathy which would enable them to respond to on-going changes. Tutors actively integrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills into content learning. They facilitate experiential learning to promote creativity and make Geography come alive. IT is also employed to enhance learning.&nbsp; These emphases are in line with the&nbsp;**Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE)**. Upon completion of their formal education, Geography students should emerge as a/an:

1 \.&nbsp;**confident person**&nbsp;who has a strong sense of right and wrong, is adaptable and resilient, knows himself/herself, is discerning in judgement, thinks independently and critically, and communicates effectively; <br>
2 \.&nbsp;**self-directed learner**&nbsp;who questions, reflects, perseveres and takes responsibility for his/her own learning;<br> 
3 \.&nbsp;**active contributor**&nbsp;who is able to work effectively in teams, is innovative, exercises initiative, takes calculated risks and strives for excellence; and <br>
4 \.&nbsp;**concerned citizen**&nbsp;who is rooted to Singapore, has a strong sense of civic responsibility, is informed about Singapore and the world, and takes an active part in bettering the lives of others around him/her.

One key area that has gained prominence is the adoption of fieldwork in the study of Geography. Local field studies and overseas field trips are conducted each year in connection with topics covered during the course.&nbsp; These are efforts made to address the requirements of the theme on Geographical Investigation.&nbsp; All students will embark on detailed studies of both physical and human phenomena such as flooding and activities involving transnational corporations.&nbsp;
