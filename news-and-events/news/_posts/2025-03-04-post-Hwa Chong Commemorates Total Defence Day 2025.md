<p>The Kah Kee Hall came alive as students immersed themselves in a musical
performance led by the Singapore Armed Forces Central Band. Voices resonated
in unison, singing National Day songs like The Road Ahead and the school
anthem, reinforcing a sense of national pride. It was more than just a
performance—it was an interactive, enlightening journey into the heart
of the Singapore Armed Forces and National Education.</p>
