<p>Jointly offered by the National Arts Council (NAC) and University of the
Arts Singapore (UAS), this scholarship recognises individuals with outstanding
artistic potential and a strong commitment to enriching Singapore’s arts
and cultural landscape.</p>
<p>Through a unique combination of rich and rigorous scholarship with high
standards of practical training, students will delve into research methodologies
and cultural insights, and leverage cutting-edge digital technology to
shape the future of contemporary Chinese theatre.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his journey, Chuhang shared, “My passion for Chinese Theatre
began with a simple dream — “用心去编织每一个美梦. 梦想把我们心连串起来。 ” This belief, nurtured
during my time in Hwa Chong Chinese Drama and continues to inspire me today,&nbsp;
alongside the conviction that “勿忘初心，方得始终！十年磨砺，一朝崛起！”— a reminder to stay
true to his path and persevere in the pursuit of his craft.</p>
<p>We wish Chuhang all the best for his journey ahead!</p>
