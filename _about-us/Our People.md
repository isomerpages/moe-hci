More than a school, Hwa Chong is where teachers and students work and play as a family. Even after graduation, Hwa Chongians maintain close ties with the school and contribute generously to society.

Hwa Chong is a home, a place where we are supported to be our best, a place where we are challenged but not judged, a place rich in traditions and yet full of innovations, a place where all can flourish.

Hwa Chong is a home and more, where we pursue our passions, create possibilities, overcome challenges and celebrate milestones. I am energised to be playing a role to support the school, my fellow colleagues and my juniors. Let us walk and enjoy the journey together.

Hwa Chong is a place where dreams come true! Very thankful to the school for the opportunities to work with excellent staff to nurture science talents and set up our very own Science Research Centre. Together with our research teams, I look forward to enhance our programmes and facilities to continue to contribute to Singapore’s pool of science talents.

I was really blessed when MOE posted me to The Chinese High School as my first school after graduation in 1984. That was the beginning of my career immersed in a community of people with immense talent and who care for others. Hwa Chong was both a home and a playing field for me to do purposeful and meaningful work.

Hwa Chong is a family and a home, a place where all students can live, learn and grow to become the best persons they can be. We hope that 自强不息 will become their motto in life, that they will establish win-win partnerships with others and they will allow 饮水思源 to guide their hearts and actions.
