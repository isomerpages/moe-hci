<p>In February 2025, five teams from the Hwa Chong Infocomm &amp; Robotics
Society (IRS) brought their creativity, determination, and collaborative
spirit to the Singapore VEX Robotics National Championship. Their hard
work shone brightly, with two teams emerging as Tournament Champions, another
achieving the Robot Skills Champion Award, and one team clinching the Excellence
Award for best overall performance! They also secured the Amaze Award,
while two other teams demonstrated remarkable perseverance, battling all
the way to the semi-finals.</p>

<p>Beyond these incredible achievements, what truly stood out was each student’s
willingness to support their teammates through every obstacle. Throughout
the competition, and during the countless hours of preparation prior to
it, the students supported one another and pushed their limits to tackle
a multitude of engineering challenges under pressure — making this journey
as much about personal and team growth as it was about honing technical
skills.</p>

<p>Thanks to their stellar performance, IRS has earned three coveted slots
at the 2025 VEX Robotics World Championship in Dallas, Texas, later this
year. We wish all our teams the very best as they take on the world stage—may
they continue to innovate, inspire, and uplift one another along the way.</p>
<p>All the best to the teams participating in the World Championships!</p>
