<p>On 4 Jul, two Weyoung teams lit up SCAPE Ground Theatre presenting their
original English songs at the SYF Youth Station Select! Live Presentation
after being shortlisted for the showcase. Both teams attained Select! in
the Produced and Live pathways — writing, arranging and producing their
own songs to set themes, while receiving invaluable feedback from industry
professionals.</p>

<p>Lo G (24A10) and Tian Xinyuan (24S64) performed “Children Flying Kites
(1988)”, an experimental, post-rock piece inspired by Nanyang Style artist,
Tay Bak Koi's, watercolour painting on lost childhood activities and how
changing times affect genuine friendships. This song arranged for live
is supported by bandmates Lo Yu Caine (24S68) and Muhammad Arfa Aqil bin
Mohd Yazid (24S63) on drums and electric guitar respectively.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Koh Jingxi (24S7D), Dannelle Lee (24S65), Zhuo Yue (24S77),
Claire Leong Wen Xin (24S72) and Germaine How Yi Ning (24S62) presented
“Missing Life”, a rock piece on cherishing fleeting moments. The piece
was originally performed at Concert Encore 2025: Caprices earlier in May,
before refining it for submission to The Youth Station Project. Supported
by Tian Xinyuan (24S64), Muhammad Aqil Arfa Bin Mohd Yazid, Lo Yu Caine
(24S68), Lee Jun Xi (24S6C) and Jin Kunyu (24S64), the song reflects on
moments we often take for granted, the gratitude we feel for having lived
them, and for holding on to what they mean to us.</p>

<p>Weyoung’s journey at SYF Youth Station is a testament to their creativity
and passion, giving them the chance to hone their artistry, sharpen their
technical skills, and push the boundaries of live and produced music. We
look forward to more original stories told through their music!</p>
