We hope that this school value of&nbsp;己立立人 ,&nbsp;己达达人 will guide them through life.

6 \. A testament to the value of a Hwa Chong education, numerous offers have been made to Hwa Chong students from local universities as well as established overseas universities. Our students also continue to be part of many prestigious university scholarship programmes which seek to nurture interdisciplinary thinkers, changemakers and leaders for the future. Provisional scholarships such as the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship have been offered to Hwa Chong students, before the release of the A-level results. This is evidence of the confidence and trust that our stakeholders have in our students’ all-round qualities.&nbsp;

7 \. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairmen and board members for your unwavering support, meticulous care and warm encouragement. It takes a village to raise a child, and an ecosystem to support a school.&nbsp;

8 \. Our gratitude also goes out to all in the Hwa Chong family including staff, past and present as well as parents and alumni who have always been the strong pillars and steady support for our students. We want to specially acknowledge and thank all the staff of Nanyang Girls’ High School and HCI for their care and commitment amidst changing circumstances.&nbsp;

9 \. As our graduates enter the next phase of their lives, we will continue in our steadfast mission to nurture our next generation of students to live with passion and lead with compassion. We will continue to encourage all to look beyond academic grades as a measure of success, embrace a myriad of opportunities and develop themselves holistically.

Heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2022! They have displayed tremendous resilience and demonstrated commitment and dedication in exceptional times, achieving holistic excellence in both academic and non-academic fields. This would not have been possible without the care, guidance and dedication of our teachers and staff; support from parents, Board members and alumni; as well as the hard work of our students.

**Hwa Chong Celebrates Holistic Excellence**

The Hwa Chong experience goes well beyond academic excellence. All students undergo a holistic education programme which empowers students to pursue their passion and serve the community. We would like to celebrate the achievements of a few of our students who especially embody the Hwa Chong vision for her students to ‘Live with Passion, Lead with compassion’.
