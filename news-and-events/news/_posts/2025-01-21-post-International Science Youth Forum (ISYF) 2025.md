<p><strong><em>Innovation Unified: Towards a Better Future</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Celebrating its 17th year, the International Science Youth Forum (ISYF)
continues to unite bright young minds and renowned scientists in pursuit
of groundbreaking discoveries. The first ISYF held in 2009 was co-organised
by Hwa Chong Institution and the Institute of Advanced Studies, NTU. This
year, the 17th iteration of the International Science Youth Forum was held
over the span of 5 days, from 6 to 10 January 2025, welcoming a total of
128 students and 45 educators from 15 countries. This year’s theme: “Innovation
Unified: Towards A Better Future” highlighted the importance of unity in
the pursuit of novel ideas and groundbreaking discoveries, to solve global
challenges confronting humanity.</p>

<p>Over the five days, participants from around the globe immersed themselves
in a variety of activities and learning experiences designed to inspire
curiosity and foster collaboration. From exploring the Singapore Maritime
Gallery to engaging with cutting-edge research at the NUS Electrical and
Computer Engineering (ECE) labs, participants exchanged insights, sparked
ideas, and built lasting friendships. Building on these immersive experiences,
the forum’s masterclasses and lectures further expanded delegates’ understanding
of cutting-edge science.</p>

<p><strong>Masterclasses</strong>
</p>
<p>ISYF stands out for its unique ability to connect young minds with world-renowned
scientists. This year’s Masterclasses spanned disciplines such as biochemistry,
theoretical physics, and more, broadening horizons and encouraging participants
to delve into new and emerging fields besides their existing interests.</p>
<p>A notable highlight of this year's event was the participation of distinguished
Nobel Laureates, such as Sir Tim Hunt, who was awarded the 2001 Nobel Prize
in Physiology or Medicine for his groundbreaking discovery of regulatory
protein molecules in cell division. Another major figure, Professor Takaaki
Kajita, shared insights from his 2015 Nobel Prize-winning work on neutrino
oscillations, a discovery that fundamentally altered our understanding
of particle physics. Additionally, Professor Yael Tauman Kalai, recipient
of the 2022 ACM Prize in Computing, conducted a class on Zero-Knowledge
Proofs, shining light on the field of computation and cryptography.</p>
<p>In addition to these global luminaries, the forum also benefited from
the expertise of distinguished local scientists, including Dr. Lee Hwee
Kuan and Dr. Li Jingmei from A*STAR, and Professors Chan Chun Yong Eric
and Ang Wee Han from NUS.</p>
<p>Among the eminent speakers was Associate Professor Hou Han Wei from NTU
School of Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering and Lee Kong Chian School
of Medicine, who expanded on recent developments in microfluidics solutions
for blood fractionation, single-cell biophysical profiling, and organ-on-chip
models for cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Wu Wei from NTU School of Civil and Environmental
Engineering shared his inspiring research on resource discovery for geothermal
and water resources, highlighting the potential for developments in Singapore’s
energy and water sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Keynote Lecture</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the highlights of ISYF 2025 was the keynote lecture on Day 4 by
Nobel Laureate Professor Hartmut Michel, who spoke on “The Challenges in
Biomedicine and Agriculture.” He discussed innovative approaches to improving
photosynthesis to enhance crop yields, and the limitations of rubisco,
an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the dark reaction of photosynthesis,
showing how research in this field could aid in resolving global hunger.
In addition, through compelling case studies, Professor Michel shared recent
advancements in AI-driven predictions of protein structures that may pave
the way for modern drugs to treat diseases. The session concluded with
a lively fireside chat and Q&amp;A session, where delegates posed thought-provoking
questions, including one on the safety of genetically modified organisms
in human diets. The engaging discussions left delegates inspired and motivated
to pursue impactful research, where scientific breakthroughs intersect
with fields like economics, sustainability, and environmentalism.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Hour</strong>
</p>
<p>Cultural Hour on Day 3 provided a vibrant platform for students to celebrate
and share their unique cultural heritages through interactive booths. Participants
and facilitators had cultural exchanges, including a display of traditional
attires like the Baju Cara Melayu from Brunei, the Sampot from Cambodia,
the Happi coat from Japan, the baro’t saya from the Philippines, and the
antique garments of Vietnam’s Nguyen Dynasty. Participants also learnt
about other interesting cultural nuggets like the Korean alphabet, dim
sum culture of Hong Kong, and a variety of festivals and dances.</p>
