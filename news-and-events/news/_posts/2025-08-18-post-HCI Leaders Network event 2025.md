<p>On 2 Aug, 10 distinguished Hwa Chong alumni from the 2018–2023 batches,
all core leaders in our flagship internationalisation programmes, returned
to share their experiences and inspire 30 JC1 &amp; 14 Sec 4 juniors (from
high school and NYGH), inspiring them to grow in leadership capacities
and civic, global, and cross-cultural competencies, and to become ‘glocal’
leaders for a flourishing Singapore.</p>

<p>This year, the theme is “The Lion’s kings/queens: Becoming global leaders
to build a flourishing Singapore,” which challenges our youths to develop
the courage, vision, and adaptability to lead on the global stage while
remaining deeply rooted in Singapore’s values. By embracing diverse perspectives
and seizing international opportunities, they can help build a resilient
and respected Singapore in a rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>Through a panel presentation, human library speed dating, and networking
tea, students gained invaluable insights from their seniors — from organising
global events to forging international friendships and seizing overseas
opportunities. These encounters equipped our alumni with the skills and
perspectives needed to lead with confidence and advance Singapore’s place
in the world.</p>

<p>We hope our students will continue this journey to become global-minded
yet locally rooted leaders — able to champion Singapore’s national interest
with courage, vision, and heart on the international stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“A point that has stuck with me is the importance of having intention and being deliberate about our actions and decisions. I think the alumni sharings all reinforced the need to slow down and reflect on what we truly want and hope to achieve through whatever project/event we are organising. Remaining grounded in that conviction and having a clear direction in what we want is essential for us to have the motivation and passion to continue, even through the toughest of times :)”</em>
